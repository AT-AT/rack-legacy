Rack Legacy tries to provide interaction with legacy environments like
PHP and CGI while still getting the Rack portability.

This software is currently ALPHA quality as it is just being used to
hack on a project that has a mix of Ruby and PHP without having to
install the entire PHP stack (Apache, mod_php, etc.). With just
php-cgi installed this middleware will allow the PHP to be executed
under a simple mongrel server (or whatever your desired flavor).

Specific things that are lacking:

TESTS
  Tests are a bit lacking now. We have end-to-end functional tests for
  PHP and some unit tests for CGI. We are currently not testing things
  like multipart POST (although early testing of form/data post seems
  to indicate that POSTing in any form should work).

SECURITY
  Although I tried to not do anything dumb this module does execute an
  external processes via a web service. Obviously security is an issue
  of concern. Right now I am just using this for local development
  (when it moves to production it gets a full Apache stack with real PHP
  and Passenger). So the security suffices for local development. An
  audit would be useful before someone put this on a production server.

FULL CGI SUPPORT
  I doubt I am fully supporting the CGI interface. I have just started
  getting POST support working and I am sure there are other things
  that are missing.

FULL PHP SUPPORT
  I have no idea what the implications are for things like safe mode
  and other PHP items of interest.

But if you can live with all that feel free to use this software and
send me patches.
