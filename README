Rack Legacy tries to provide interaction with legacy environments like
PHP and CGI while still getting the Rack portability.

This software is currently ALPHA quality as it is just being used to
hack on a project that has a mix of Ruby and PHP without having to
install the entire PHP stack (Apache, mod_php, etc.). With just
php-cgi installed this middleware will allow the PHP to be executed
under a simple mongrel server (or whatever your desired flavor).

Specific things that are lacking:

* TESTS- We are currently not testing the CGI part very much. The PHP
tests implicitly test the CGI work as the PHP is being executed through
the CGI interface. But it would be nice to have some plain CGI tests
also.

* SECURITY - Although I tried to not do anything dumb this module does
execute external processes via a web service. Obviously security is an
issue of concern. Right now I am just using this for local development
(when it moves to production it gets a full Apache stack with real PHP
and Passenger). So the security suffices for local development. An audit
would be useful before someone put this on a production server.

* FULL CGI SUPPORT - I doubt I am fully supporting the CGI interface.
I have really only tested GET requests (although POST are coming soon).
There is also dealing with things like file uploads.

But if you can live with all that feel free to use this software and
send me patches.
