Polish Tests Up
---------------
Last few commits have not included tests. Need to polish that up.
Specially we need to:

* Rails compat doesn't really have any testing. Considering this is
  highly breakable between versions it would be good to have a way
  to automatically test this.
* If a document needed to flush our library used to block. Refactored
  code that collects response but need to write tests to verify this.
* We are not testing the htaccess processing flag
* We are not testing cases where the app returns a status other than 200
  although our code now does carry this on to rack and removes the
  header.
