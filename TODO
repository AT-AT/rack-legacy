Things I will probably do:

PACKAGED LIBRARY
  This library needs to be packed up as a gem so it can easily be used
  in a project
LEGACY SERVER
  I want to create a executable that is a bit like the test server so
  if I have a pure PHP (or CGI) project I can just run something like
  "legacy-rack" and it will start a rack server that service up the
  current directory.

Ideas for others:

SECURITY
  I tried to not do anything dumb but this code isn't audited either.
  For that reason I recommend this tool be used for only for development
  purposes and not used in production until someone takes a closer look
  at security.

PERFORMANCE
  We could possibly support FastCGI and some sort of mod_php-like
  interface to allow greater performance. Useful if someone uses this
  in production. 

CORNER CASES
  I doubt I am supporting the full CGI spec. I am sure there are corner
  cases where this software doesn't work. Also I don't know what the
  implications are for things like php safe mode.
