Things I will probably do:

BETTER ERROR HANDLING:
  If the application returns an error (i.e. exit status other than 0)
  we set the HTTP response code to 500 and return the text "Error". It
  would be nice to provide more information (like the stdout and stderr
  from the program being run).

Ideas for others:

SECURITY
  I tried to not do anything dumb but this code isn't audited either.
  For that reason I recommend this tool be used for only for development
  purposes and not used in production until someone takes a closer look
  at security.

PERFORMANCE
  We could possibly support FastCGI and some sort of mod_php-like
  interface to allow greater performance. Useful if someone uses this
  in production. 

CORNER CASES
  I doubt I am supporting the full CGI spec. I am sure there are corner
  cases where this software doesn't work. Also I don't know what the
  implications are for things like php safe mode.
