Things I will probably not implement but I welcome others to do.

== Security

I tried to not do anything dumb but this code isn't audited either.
For that reason I recommend this tool be used for only for development
purposes and not used in production until someone takes a closer look
at security.

== Performance

We could possibly support FastCGI and some sort of mod_php-like
interface to allow greater performance. Useful if someone uses this
in production. 

== Corner Cases

I doubt I am supporting the full CGI spec. I am sure there are corner
cases where this software doesn't work. Also I don't know what the
implications are for things like php safe mode and other php corner
cases.

== Standard Error Capture Hacks

Currently I am using a tempfile to capture the standard error from
the CGI script. This seems a little hackish. Would like to just
capture the standard error directly.

== Forward Thinking

This code is un-tested in Ruby 1.9
